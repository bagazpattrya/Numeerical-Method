# Numerical-Method
Solving numerical problem with Bisection and Regula-Falsi method using Python

right now, i've just upload the bisection only, regula falsi soon

#How to use it?
you have to define the function inside the code
I've tried using eval(equation) before, but it deemed to be unsafe and it cannot handle complex function that involve trigonometry, logarithm, etc

it would take 4 input from you, 
1. the starting number or the lowest number to seearch
2. the ending numbeer or the highest number to search
3. iteration count or how many you want to iterate the function
4. and tolerance, or how accurate you would like it to be in form of decimal value like 0.001, 0.0001 etc

#Issues
the program would compare the F(x) value with the max tolerance, i set it to be absolute value, but i'm not really sure whether it's correct or not, or should i leave it as standard number? 

i think that's all
cheers!

It's me Bagaz Pattrya!
